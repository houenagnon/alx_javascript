Create a function divideBy:

    It takes into argument firstNumber (number)
    It returns a function that takes into argument secondNumber (number)
        It returns the second number divided by the first number

Create a function addBy:

    It takes into argument firstNumber (number)
    It returns a function that takes into argument secondNumber (number)
        It returns the sum of the two numbers

Create four closures:

    addBy100, that uses the function addBy with the number 100
    addBy1000, that uses the function addBy with the number 1000
    divideBy10, that uses the function divideBy with the number 10
    divideBy100, that uses the function divideBy with the number 100
